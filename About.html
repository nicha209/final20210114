                <P style="color:steelblue;">Kiddi Kollege Inc. started from humble beginnings back in the mid-1950’s.
                    The owner, Geraldine
                    Dolinar grew the business out of her own basement in Kansas City, Kansas.</P>
                <P style="color:steelblue;"> In the 1950s the words Child Care Center, Preschool, or even Daycare had
                    yet to be spoken. The care
                    of young children at that time usually fell to the local church or the domestic care giver.</P>
                <p style="color:steelblue;">Few people thought about children’s education at such a young age in
                    addition to their care, but
                    Geraldine recognized this opportunity. She was not satisfied with the level of attention that the
                    local children were receiving when it came to their education.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 my-4">
                <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="image/about2.JPG">
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 my-4">
                <p style="color:steelblue;">At the time she had her third child (who is our current Regional Director)
                    there was an opportunity
                    to address this issue in the local community. She noticed a demand was growing for high quality
                    childcare with a focus on early childhood education and found a sizable demand for families needing
                    this service. She told the families of the community if she did decide to open a care center, that
                    she would start an educational center, “a preschool… she would not be a babysitter” (Geraldine would
                    always correct anyone who called Kiddi Kollege a Day Care).</p>
                <p style="color:steelblue;">So Geraldine decided to do it herself and develop an early childhood
                    education program. Ultimately,
                    she became an entrepreneur while also giving her the option to care for and educate her daughter.
                    She told the families of the community if she did decide to open a care center.

        <div class="content">
            <p class="has-text-justified" style="color:navy;">One reason Kiddi Kollege has managed to stay in business
                all these years is the
                way we work. We remain focused and consistent in our services by having a strong vision for what we do.
                This
                vision helps us keep the big picture in mind – helping children and their families build bright futures.
