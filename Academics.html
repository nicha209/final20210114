        <p class="has-text-justified">Our students are recognized for their strong academic achievement as well as for
          their development as responsible and caring citizens. The rigorous ES curriculum has been developed from U.S.
          standards that RIS has adopted school-wide. Core subjects are based on the American Education Reaches Out
          (AERO) standards and taught by the grade-level classroom teachers. We integrate Reader’s and Writer’s Workshop
          to provide a balanced literacy model, and science and math are inquiry-based courses with a focus on critical
          thinking all skills that are vital for success in the future. Across all grades, students have access to
          devices and lessons about the proper use of technology so teachers and students can safely use digital tools
          and resources in innovative and creative ways. In grades 1 and 2, each student has access to a class iPad, and
          in grades 3–5, RIS has a 1:1 Chromebook program. You can read more about RIS’ instructional technology
          philosophy and policies on the page.</p>
        <p class="has-text-justified">Beyond the core subjects of math, reading, writing, science, and social studies,
          your child will have daily opportunities to experience and explore other interests and talents in their
          specialist art, music, physical education, a second language, and values. Our students are also introduced to
          skills and concepts in health and wellness. All elementary students are required to take Thai language and
          literacy, and our non-Thai students also learn about Thai culture. Collectively, these subjects not only offer
          elementary students a well-rounded school experience, but they help our children learn how to be considerate
          world citizens who are aware of the importance of caring about other people and our environment.</p>
        <p class="has-text-justified">Our students’ social and emotional well-being is further supported by the
          curriculum. All of our teachers are skilled at adapting learning to individual student’s needs and meeting
          them where they are, developmentally. In all grades, we encourage students to make appropriate choices and
          exercise their independence, which promotes autonomy and a sense of all of which are essential in developing
          well-adjusted, happy children who can focus on their learning.</p>

      </span>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="has-text-justified">Every day is a good day for learning and making friends in elementary school. Most
          days start out with circle time. This is a community building time when students and teachers can address
          issues in the class or in the world or sometimes share short lessons on health or community issues. From there
          students move into core subject and specialist lessons. Each day has 2 blocks of reading and writing and an
          extended math period. Listening and speaking are integrated into each subject throughout the day. Elementary
          puts a lot of emphasis on collaborative learning and students spend time throughout the day working in small
          groups and on collaborative projects. We take pride in the nurturing the student-centered learning environment
          we provide our children.</p>
        <p class="has-text-justified">Beyond the core lessons in math, reading, writing, science and social studies,
          your child will be given daily opportunities to experience visual art, performing art, physical education,
          second language and values courses, as well as being introduced to skills and lessons in health and wellness.
